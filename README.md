The fast rise of online education, fueled by massive open online courses (MOOC), has been unparalleled. This expansion required several qualities common in blockchains, most notably (i) the absence of a central authority and (ii) verifiable certifications. Skill certification today requires need-based abilities, which can be tough to get in a traditional university system. A course on Android app development, for example, may not be included in a university curriculum, but a student competent in it may be important to specific organizations. However, the organization must hire the student uncertified, which may result in inaccurate judgement, or must test the skill on its own, which is costly. As a result, there is a demand for blockchain-based easy management and assessment of student competencies. This system also conduct the test and get the
top-ranked without taking the effort of checking a large amount of answerscript.
